------------------------------------------------------------

(April 3rd) Working into wee hours of the night with the only chance of
staying awake lying in the hands of the girls in our room at 3:47AM...
stripping naked.

(April 12th) I had decided after careful delibration to modify the 
backbone of the program (dynamic libraries) as it has been producing the
following problems:
	-Seems to remain in memory even after the library is freed
	-Large, as they require being linked with graphics library
	In it's place I plan to implement a powerful scripting language.

(April 15th) I have determined to continue from my previous course
which was without programmable scripts.  I have, however, kept the
source code to the script interpretor which I will continue as soon
as I have completed the more relevant tasks such as creating the
worlds for the fair.

(April 16th) I have completely given up on the scripting language for
the moment, although I envision myself to be futily attempting
to implement or at least further develop this feature on my way to
Timmons.  I worry that the judges in Timmons will not fully
appreciate the program, so I'm left tring to implement practical
implementations for the program and develop technical internal
features as well.  In any event, today I have developed further the
object and world object definition file formats to be even more
intuitive and easy to develop.  Now, the user does not have to be
concerned about the number of objects, cameras, and lights... as the
program dynamically allocates memory for this through the use
of linked lists.  As well, the source code has greatly benefitted from
using linked lists and the permutations performed on them, whereas
before arrays where used.

(April 17th) Implemented Z-Buffering and attempted to implement
sin and cos lookup tables, but this was not as fesible as I had hoped
as the use of dynamic link libraries prevented their usefulness. The
code still remains, however, in case future modifications make
it more fesible.

(April 18th) Optimizations galore!  I've been spending the day adjusting
the old code to take advantage of the usage of my implementation
of objects as linked lists and ZBuffering and the code is much more
understandable and much faster.

(April 21st) Installed CodeGuard to help me in detecting possible
memory leaks and to ensure that no embarassing errors (like that
which happened to Bill Gates on national television) pop up.

(April 26th) I started paving the way for the ability to create worlds
directly from the main module.  However, this day has been wasted as I
haven't felt or have been very productive... one thing is for sure...
I wake up tommorrow fully prepared for the task at hand but will be
limited in time due to school work.

(April 27th) As I anticipated I am fully awake and ready to sit for
hours and program... but cannot due to homework and study!  Oh well,
I'll have to find some way to do both without lossing quality.  In any
event, armed with the powerful CodeGuard debugging tool I discovered
a bug that caused the computer to lock up and for the texture mapping to
not work... the problem was an overflow in the vertex list than caused
program to overwrite other data until a fatal exception occured.  I've
also reprogrammed the classes to look more like to virtual representation
presented in the definition files.

(April 28th) Worked on the further implementation of the ability to
create worlds from within the module.  The program is now fully
debugged with all errors and memory leaks fixed and cleaned up.  The
only problem that remains is a problem with the zbuffering and clipping
of the horizon.

(April 29th) Further work on the world editing implementation.

(April 30th) Further work on world editing implementation... tring
to pave the way for a productive weekend!  The only problem being a
consistant interference from CodeGuard resulting in annoying bugs because
the compiler I'm used appears to be flawed.

(April 31st) Found the bug that I was attributing to CodeGuard... apparently
it was in fact a problem with the installed Yamaha Software Wavetable
synthesis and I was extremely fortunate in discovering this error.

(May 1st-2nd) Worked relentlessly to implement world editing capabilities
into the program.  The result has been worth the effort and the program
now looks and behaves like a commercial quality program.

(May 3rd) With a pounding headache from staying up all night tapping away
at the keyboard, I sit here lifelessly, satisifed in the knowledge
that I have completed in my efforts to enable the ability to create
worlds from within the main module.  The result is better than I
had even dreamed!!  The program is now complete and I will now focus on
the development of worlds.

(May 8th) I finally discovered the reason that the horizon was not
being drawn in some frames.  The reason being that the object had a
distance of 0 -- and therefore, could not be drawn because it was
not between the camera limits.  I corrected this by only ensuring that
objects greater than the YON are not drawn.

ERROR:
	while(Token->Get() != TOK_RCB)

List of things to be completed:

-Focus on:
	-the future scriptability
		-Allows object class to support other PROPERTIES and METHODS
	-database of objects and libraries
	-ability to create worlds from within the main module

-Make presentation on step by step projection of points from 3d to 2d
-Fix timer
